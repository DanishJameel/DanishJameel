## Projects 📚

Here are some highlights of my data science projects:

### Project 1: Predictive Customer Churn Analysis 📉
In this project, I built a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churn for a telecommunications company. The model achieved an accuracy of 85% and provided valuable insights into customer behavior.

### Project 2: Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data 📱📊
Using natural language processing techniques, I analyzed millions of tweets to determine the sentiment around a product launch. The sentiment analysis model achieved an accuracy of 82% and helped the client make informed marketing decisions.

### Project 3: Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions 💰🔒
I developed an anomaly detection algorithm to identify fraudulent transactions in a large financial dataset. The model successfully detected 95% of fraudulent cases, saving the client significant financial losses.

## Code Samples 💻

Here are some code samples showcasing my expertise:
